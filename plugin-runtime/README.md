# plugin-runtime implemented in Deno

## Q&A

### 1. why deno and not node native 3rd parties?

> i tried using `isolated-vm` but it doesn't seem to compile for electron so i scraped that idea and since spawing a new node process and loading the plugin is not as safe as the secure-by-default runtime deno. So its making my life easier.

### ask for further questions in the issues tab with the prefix `plugin-runtime`!
